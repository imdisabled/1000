   N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-domain.com/webhook/generate-quote
   ```

2. **n8n Workflow Structure**:
   Create a workflow in n8n that accepts POST requests with:
   ```json
   {
     "day_number": 123,
     "date": "2025-08-30",
     "task": "Complete morning workout routine"

   ```

3. **Expected Response**:
   Your n8n workflow should return:
